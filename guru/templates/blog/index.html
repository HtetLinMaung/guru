        Success is a few simple disciplines, practiced every day; while failure
        is simply a few errors in judgment, repeated every day. â€”Jim Rohn
        Someone said that the one-percent improvement approach (also known as
        continuous improvement) can make one win a medal at the Olympic Games.
        It might not be the only reason to apply this approach in your life.
        Continuous improvement is a great tool (or rather a mindset) you can use
        to achieve your long term goals, and become more efficient, organized,
        productive and happy.
